# NextJS Markdown Netlify Boilerplate

Simple, minimal boilerplate to get started with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) while maintaining content within Markdown and [Netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

Also contains a template for state management using only `React.useReducer` and `React.useContext`.

> Status: In development

> This is an organized and modifyied version from [netlifycms-nextjs](https://github.com/masives/netlifycms-nextjs).
